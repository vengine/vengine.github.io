# VEngine
### Introduction:
&ensp;&ensp;VEngine is a 3D game engine, The underlying code is built by C++ and game logic is written
using Swift, It has an efficient and lightweight rendering architecture and collision detection system as well as an easy-to-use programming interface, Anyone who has mastered Swift can easily get started and implement game logic with the least amount of code. VEngine currently only supports macOS and iOS, but it will support Android, Windows, PS4, XB1 and other platforms in the near future, Implementing "write once, run anywhere" using Swift language.

### Main Features:
1. Fully concurrent architecture that maximizes hardware performance.
2. Support for writing game logic modules using Swift.
3. The creative Material Scripting System writes cross-platform material through the material scripting language, avoiding writing platform related shader code.
4. The creative Agent System organizes and manages logic modules to make the organization of game logic clearer.
5. Powerful layered Animation Manager that enables weighted blending of multiple animations to achieve smooth transitions.
6. Built-in an efficient lightweight Collision System that eases the burden on physical systems and facilitates performance optimization.
7. The dynamic Lighting System supports three types of lights: parallel light, spotlight, and point light, enabling dynamic soft shadows based on ESM.
8. Support COLLADA file format, can directly import COLLADA model, material, texture into the resource system.
9. Powerful Resource System.
10. Easy-to-use Editor support.
11. Powerful Scene System.
12. Sound System based on OpenAL.
13. The abstraction layer of the graphics API, in order to support multiple graphics APIs,
currently supports OpenGL and Metal, and will support OpenGL ES, Vulkan, and DirectX in the future.
14. Multi-platform support, core code written in C++ makes the entire game engine have a natural cross-platform advantage, currently supports macOS and iOS platforms, and will support Android, Windows, PS4, XB1 and other platforms in the future.
